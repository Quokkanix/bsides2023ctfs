    <h1>Panda's Writeups</h1>
    <p>Writeups done by a noob who has never used a computer before. I managed to solve a few though with the help of ChatGPT (and an occasional hint from some humans).</p>

    <h2>Porcine Enclosure</h2>
    <p><i>Banner challenge Sigma</i><br>
    Someone has tracked the Cybear's physical location and is leaving hidden messages. Is it a MAYHEM agent, or a friend? They were last spotted near the CTF Admin desk.
    These challenges require looking around the physical venue.</p>
    <p>Okay, so for this one, I knew it was a Banner challenge. I went over to the CTF Admin Desk and saw the banner with the code on..<br>
    <img src="pigpen.png"><br>
    I instantly recognized the code from an escape room I played before. In it, there's a device called a 'Chrono Decoder'.<br>
    <img src="pigpen3.png"><img src="pigpen2.png"><br>
    I couldn't remember the name of the darn code though. Porcine Enclosure? Pigpen. Found a pigpen image and was able to get the code! Yay! :D</p>

    <h2>Not A Six Dot Matrix</h2>
    <p><i>Banner challenge Zeta</i><br>
    Someone has tracked the Cybear's physical location and is leaving hidden messages. Is it a MAYHEM agent, or a friend? They were first spotted near the CTF hall entrance.<br>
    These challenges require looking around the physical venue.</p>
    <p>I knew that it related to this picture below:<br>
    <img src="notbraille.png" alt="Image 1"><br>
    But I've never seen it before. My way of solving it? Well... I googled 'What is a six dot matrix.' It came up with Braille... so... this is NOT braille...<br>
    <img src="notbraille2.png" alt="Image 2"><br>
    So I googled 'What is NOT braille'. Nothing came up in the normal search (at least not in the first 5 results, which is the limit of my attention span), so I checked the images, and Bingo! something jumped out at me.<br>

    I had a look at the site and learned about what ELIA is. Once I knew, I was able to solve it! Yay!</p>

    <h2>Scalable Vector Grille</h2>
    <p>I did this by downloading the two files. They fit on top of each other, but the flag was still not correct.</p>
