        <h1>Panda's Writeups</h1>
        <p>Some bsides 23 writeups done by a noob who has never used a computer before. I super loved the comic theme and all the graphics and css and bears oh my!</p>

        <h2>Porcine Enclosure</h2>
        <p><i>Banner challenge Sigma<br></i></p>
        <p>Okay, so for this one, I knew it was a Banner challenge. I went over to the CTF Admin Desk and saw the banner with the code on..<br>
        <p><img src="pigpen.png" alt="Pigpen Image"></p>
        <p>I instantly recognized the code from an escape room I played before. In it, there's a device called a 'Chrono Decoder'.<br>
        <p><img src="pigpen3.png" alt="Pigpen Image 3"></p>
        <p><img src="pigpen2.png" alt="Pigpen Image 2"></p>
        <p>I couldn't remember the name of the darn code though. Porcine Enclosure = Pig Pen. I did a quick image search for pig pen to help me translate it and get the flag! Yay! :D</p>

        <h2>Not A Six Dot Matrix</h2>
        <p><i>Banner challenge Zeta</i><br>
        <p>I knew that it related to this picture below:<br>
        <p><img src="notbraille.png" alt="Image 1"></p>
        <p>But I've never seen it before. My way of solving it? Well... I googled 'What is a six dot matrix.' It came up with Braille... so... this is NOT braille...<br>
        <p><img src="notbraille2.png" alt="Image 2"></p>
        <p>So I googled 'What is NOT braille'. Nothing came up in the normal search (at least not in the first 5 results, which is the limit of my attention span), so I checked the images, and Bingo! something jumped out at me.<br>
        <p><img src="notbraille3.png" alt="Image 2"></p>
        <p>I had a look at the site and learned about what ELIA is. Once I knew, I was able to solve it! Yay!</p>

        <h2>Scalable Vector Grille</h2>
        <p>I did this by downloading the two files.. two images, which fit on top of each other quite nicely ..</p>
        <p><img src="svg1.png" alt="SVG 1"></p>
        <p><i>cybears{Tif6LVAiVs4nGerY}</i>? Nope.. that's not correct. I doubt it would it have been easy anyway .. so let me check that svg in more detail ..</p>
        <p><img src="svg2.png" alt="SVG 2"></p>
        <p>Yeah sus as right? let me remove that transformations ..</p>
        <p><img src="svg3.png" alt="SVG 3"></p>
        <p>Still not good enough ..</p>
        <p><img src="svg4.png" alt="SVG 4"></p>
        <p> Okay having a look at the names.. they're all a bit odd.. looks like someone went through and duplicated.. let me delete the extras ..
        <p><img src="svg5.png" alt="SVG 5"></p>
        <p>Okay and this one has no line.. hmm let me fix that ..</p>
        <p><img src="svg6.png" alt="SVG 6"></p>
        <p>Okay the rectangles are numbered.. i'm guessing we should order the chars from 0-14.. i'll colour them in rainbow order ..
        <p><img src="svg7.png" alt="SVG 7"></p>
        <p>Oh! I can't see the orange or cyan one.. turned out I missed a # before the colors .. 
        <p><img src="svg8.png" alt="SVG 8"></p>
        <p>That's better .. but still no cyan one.. 
        <p><img src="svg9.png" alt="SVG 9"></p>
        <p>I put the chars in order using the coours to follow .. still.. there's one missing.. but that's okay.. I can guess that it's a g or a G now.. and yay! Got the flag.</p>
       
        
        <h2>Legal Eagle</h2>
        <p><i>Did you read the fine print?</i></p>
        <p>So there's a special place in hell for the person who made this challenge. </p>


        <h2>My Head Hurts</h2>
        <p>I go to the URL<br> 
        ... http://my-head-hurts.chal.cybears.io/<br>
        Nothing there.. so I'm all 'okay wut'.. the challenge says 'My Head Hurts' so prob something to do with the headers.. so let me open up dev tools and take a look.</p>
        <p><img src="headhurts"></p>
        Okay.. I learned what an eTag is but it had nothing to do with the flag. Now, vary says it can negotiate/accept/accept-language..<br>
        I tried changing the language to German, but nothing changed. I also tried changing neogitate but it didnt work ..
        <p><img src="headhurts2.png"></p>
        So I changed accept to plz give me a flag.. not exactly expecting it to do anything.. buuuuuuuut ..
<p><img src="headhurts3.png"></p>
        INTERESTING! VERY INTERESTING! A clue! I go to both flag.html and flag.xyz.. it's a picture of an absolutely beautiful man with flags on his head.
        <p><img src="headhurts4.png"></p>
        <p>I thought about checking the actual file itself but was told by a helpful nerd that it wouldn't be needed.. so back onto playing with headers ..<br>
        I go to flag.html and flag.xyz and try playing with the headers there and eventually get something different!</p>
        <p><img src="headhurts5.png"></p>
        <p>So I need to use some bonjour croissants.. I'll admit I did bunch of stuff that was completely incorrect and got me nothing except a punch to my ego until I decide to use curl instead.. 
        <p><img src="headhurts6.png"></p>
        <p>Turns out I was using dev tools wrong which is why it wasn't coming up.. but hoorah I got it!</p>
        <p><img src="headhurts6.png"></p>
        <p>The thing I loved about this challenge is that I could tell I was getting closer and closer bit by bit.. I really enjoyed it despite being frustrated at times..  I learned a heap I didn't know about headers and also how to use dev tools a bit better..</p>

        <h2>Cryptic Hacker Crossword</h2>
        <p>I got first blood on this one! But I have to admit .. much credit goes to Chat GPT. That being said though, it helped me learn a bunch of things which is fantastic! (eg gentoo package manager being called portage).

        <h2>Dark/QR/Light</h2>
        <p>Coming </p>

        <h2>Passwordle</h2>
        <p>My absolutely favourite CTF. It was written by the guy who did the awesome design and theme this year. What a guy!</p>
        <p>This was very beginner friendly and actually _fun_ rather than _funstruating_. It plays just like wordle and it gives you password hints. I will confess when I started running out of guesses on the one that references transformers I opened up a new private window on my browser so I could get more guesses >.></p>
