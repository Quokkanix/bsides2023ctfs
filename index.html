    <h1>Panda's Writeups</h1>
    <p>Writeups done by a noob who has never used a computer before. I managed to solve a few though with the help of ChatGPT (and an occasional hint from some humans).</p>

    <h2>Porcine Enclosure</h2>
    <p><i>Banner challenge Sigma</i><br>
    Someone has tracked the Cybear's physical location and is leaving hidden messages. Is it a MAYHEM agent, or a friend? They were last spotted near the CTF Admin desk.
    These challenges require looking around the physical venue.</p>
    <p>Okay, so for this one, I knew it was a Banner challenge. I went over to the CTF Admin Desk and saw the banner with the code on..<br>
    <p><img src="pigpen.png" alt="Pigpen Image"></p>
    <p>I instantly recognized the code from an escape room I played before. In it, there's a device called a 'Chrono Decoder'.<br>
    <p><img src="pigpen3.png" alt="Pigpen Image 3"></p>
    <p><img src="pigpen2.png" alt="Pigpen Image 2"></p>
    <p>I couldn't remember the name of the darn code though. Porcine Enclosure? Pigpen. Found a pigpen image and was able to get the code! Yay! :D</p>

    <h2>Not A Six Dot Matrix</h2>
    <p><i>Banner challenge Zeta</i><br>
    Someone has tracked the Cybear's physical location and is leaving hidden messages. Is it a MAYHEM agent, or a friend? They were first spotted near the CTF hall entrance.<br>
    These challenges require looking around the physical venue.</p>
    <p>I knew that it related to this picture below:<br>
    <p><img src="notbraille.png" alt="Image 1"></p>
    <p>But I've never seen it before. My way of solving it? Well... I googled 'What is a six dot matrix.' It came up with Braille... so... this is NOT braille...<br>
    <p><img src="notbraille2.png" alt="Image 2"></p>
    <p>So I googled 'What is NOT braille'. Nothing came up in the normal search (at least not in the first 5 results, which is the limit of my attention span), so I checked the images, and Bingo! something jumped out at me.<br>
    <p><img src="notbraille3.png" alt="Image 2"></p>
    <p>I had a look at the site and learned about what ELIA is. Once I knew, I was able to solve it! Yay!</p>

    <h2>Scalable Vector Grille</h2>
    <p>I did this by downloading the two files. They fit on top of each other. Yay! I got the flag already??</p>
    <p><img src="svg1.png" alt="SVG 1"></p>
    <p>Nope.. so let me check ..</p>
    <p><img src="svg2.png" alt="SVG 2"></p>
<p>yeah sus as right? let me remove that transformations ..</p>
    <p><img src="svg3.png" alt="SVG 3"></p>
    <p>Still not good enough ..</p>
    <p><img src="svg4.png" alt="SVG 4"></p>
    <p> Okay having a look at the names.. they're all a bit odd.. looks like someone went through and duplicated.. let me delete the extras ..
    <p><img src="svg5.png" alt="SVG 5"></p>
    <p>Okay and this one has no line.. hmm let me fix that ..</p>
    <p><img src="svg6.png" alt="SVG 6"></p>
    <p>Okay the rectangles are numbered.. i'm guessing we should order the chars from 0-14.. i'll colour them in rainbow order ..
    <p><img src="svg7.png" alt="SVG 7"></p>
    <p>Oh! I can't see the orange or cyan one.. turned out I missed a # before the colours .. 
    <p><img src="svg8.png" alt="SVG 8"></p>
    <p>That's better .. but still no cyan one.. 
    <p><img src="svg9.png" alt="SVG 9"></p>
    <p>I put the chars in order still.. there's one missing.. but that's okay.. I can guess that it's a g or a G now.. and yay! Got the flag.</p>
